# SPACElogic Maker Space Arcade

Open `index.html` on the TV (serve it over https, e.g. GitHub Pages) and pick a game.

## Circuit Racers (phones as steering wheels)
1. Pick **Circuit Racers** on the TV. A QR code appears in the lobby.
2. Each player scans it with their phone camera, taps **Enable steering**, and holds the phone sideways like a wheel.
3. Tilt to steer. Left pedal = brake, right pedal = gas (auto-gas is on by default), **NITRO** button for a boost.
4. Player 1 can press **START RACE** on their phone, or use the TV (hand cursor / mouse / Enter).

- Up to 4 phones, split-screen on the TV. Empty seats are filled by CPU racers (6 cars total).
- Pick up gears to refill nitro. Toolboxes slow you down.
- No phone? Keyboard: arrows/WASD to drive, space for nitro.
- Phone to TV link is peer-to-peer (WebRTC via the free PeerJS relay). Both need internet access.
  To use your own relay add `?signal=host:port` (or `host:port:s` for https) to the TV URL.
- Phone settings (gear icon): auto-gas, invert steering, touch wheel fallback, re-centre.

## Filament Slice (hand tracking)
Swipe both hands (or the mouse) fast through flying filament spools (+10) and circuit boards (+15). Keep a combo going for up to x5.
Avoid the red-hot nozzles: each one you slice costs a power cell (3 lives). A shift lasts 75 s.

Files: `index.html` (TV: menu, Maker Run, Circuit Racers), `controller.html` (phone).
